#Come's NodeJS Openshift Stack

This is a basic stack that I use in my projects to go faster. 
This is the bare minimum of a Mean Stack

###Configuration

* fulfill the MongoDB database URL in the file config/config.js
* uncomment the moogoose line in server.js when you're db is set
* you can also fullfill the *secret* field in config/config.js

The application should run seamlessly. Feel free to modify any of the files.
